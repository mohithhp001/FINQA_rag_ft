The sound policies and timely interventions of RBI have ensured that we were well prepared for the monetary tightening that happened in the developed world after the inflationary pressures manifested themselves across the globe. The Bank has responded to the evolving liquidity scenario and calibrated its response over the past year. The financial year gone by has seen the GDP in India grow at 8.2 per cent while global GDP growth was 3.2 per cent in 2023. We continue to remain the world’s fastest growing major economy, with GDP growth projected at 7.2 per cent in the current financial year. This has come about despite a slowdown in global growth. The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure development, including roads, highways, railways and housing.

The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure development, including roads, highways, railways and housing. Between FY22 and FY24, overall capex growth in the economy stood at 11.0 per cent on an average with government doing the heavy lifting. Private sector investment also showed some signs of resurgence in sectors such as cement, steel, and oil and gas. Growth has also received a fillip through a rise in manufacturing and construction activity. This has been due to a combination of lower input costs, Government support to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector through Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and large scale manufacturing through schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI). Overall, the past fiscal year has shown strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the country. However, slowdown in household savings has put a strain on liquidity across the economy. Your Bank has been well placed to obtain the benefits of this growth and has actively funded the small and medium enterprises that form the backbone of the economy as well retail consumers, managing well within the constraints of liquidity and elevated costs of incremental funding. Reaping Synergies of the Merger As we complete one year of the merger, I am happy to note that the process of integration has been completed seamlessly and efficiently across all dimensions of the business and customer services and we have put in place robust risk management and compliance functions from a supervisory perspective for the Bank and the subsidiaries, which now cover a substantially large footprint in the financial services domain. The synergies of the merger are being manifested through the combined strengths of the two merged entities, the home loan expertise of erstwhile HDFC Limited and the extensive distribution franchise of HDFC Bank. Today, most of our branches are selling home loans, including those in semi urban and rural locations. As the nation's growth story unfolds, we stand prepared to reap the benefits through this historic combination. Dear Stakeholders, Greetings! It gives me immense pleasure to present to you the Integrated Annual Report of your Bank for the Financial Year 2023-24.

These Committees facilitate the governance and supervisory responsibilities of the Board members as they provide oversight and feedback on critical areas and the performance of the management of the Bank. Cognisant of our status as a large financial conglomerate we have also put in place group level oversight of compliance and risk management of the diverse subsidiaries, while at the same time making their respective management teams accountable for governance and compliance.

Given the large scale of our operations and strong profitability, we recognise the criticality of giving back to the very communities in which we operate. Economic and financial wellbeing of society is what every responsible lender should aspire for. Our commitment to this principle is underscored in our CSR programme. Our core focus areas are Rural Development, Education, Skilling and Livelihood, Healthcare and Financial Literacy and Inclusion. Our Bank has cumulatively impacted over 10 crore lives through our social initiatives. As a Bank, we also stand resolute with the government in its endeavour to promote financial inclusion. The CSR programme of your Bank supplements the government’s flagship welfare schemes aimed at improving the lives of farmers, protecting vulnerable segments of society through micro insurance, pensions, loans to MSMEs and urban and rural livelihood initiatives, amongst others. As a large financier, we understand the need to align with the country’s strategy towards decarbonisation. The Board of your Bank increased oversight on ESG disclosures and climate-related risks as well as keeping abreast with evolving regulatory frameworks. In Conclusion I extend my sincere thanks to all our stakeholders for their continued support, and most of all, to the large HDFC Bank family of over two hundred thousand people. Needless to say, it is the collective passion and commitment of all that will allow us to achieve the future growth of the institution.

The year gone by was one of both, continuity and change. Continuity, as India remained the fastest growing major economy in the world; change, as there was a transformational merger between parent, HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank. I feel fortunate to be a part of the Indian economy right now, which is teeming with opportunities. As per the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India will continue to be a driver for global growth in the foreseeable future. Last year, as you’re aware, we concluded the merger of HDFC Limited with the Bank, a momentous event in the organisation’s history. Your Bank worked on fortifying all aspects of the merger, during the nine months of Financial Year 2023-24 spent as a merged entity. The successful conclusion of the merger and seamless integration of the entities have further added to my confidence in the organisation’s resilience and pride in the execution capability of the team at HDFC Bank and HDFC Limited, which is now part of the Bank. With our financial discipline, prudent investment in technology and a passionate commitment to customer centricity, I’m pleased to report that your Bank has performed well in a year that witnessed such a significant development.

The country’s GDP growth averaged 8.3 per cent annually over the last three fiscal years, the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. This was supported by a capital expenditure boost (particularly in infrastructure development, including roads, railways, and housing), moderating inflation, strong manufacturing performance and healthy consumer demand, especially in urban areas. Overall credit growth has been in double digits since April 2022. Higher demand for consumer durables and greater retail spends have boosted retail credit growth. Retail loans have increased at a CAGR of 19 per cent over the last five years, outpacing the growth in nominal GDP. During this period, the RBI has issued advisory to banks on strengthening the acquisition, monitoring and collection process as the unsecured loan growth has outpaced the overall loan growth. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) anticipates India’s GDP growth to be at 7.2 per cent in Financial Year 2024- 25. Economic activity is likely to be supported by further pick-up in private capital expenditure and continued Government capital spending. In addition, domestic consumer spending is expected to see further recovery particularly in rural areas. Moreover, the benefit from Government reforms and support measures over the last few years, like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes is likely to boost manufacturing activity and attract FDI flows. Besides, a continued diversification of supply chains to newer emerging markets is likely to benefit investment flows into India. India is clearly in a good place for economic growth and we feel well placed to capitalise on the positive environment. The Merger We’ve recently completed one year of the merger which formally came into effect on July 1, 2023. In many ways it is now a new organisation with a different balance sheet composition. For example, it has a higher proportion of borrowing at 21 per cent versus 8 per cent pre-merger and a lower CASA ratio. Key metrics of the new organisation will be different than that of pre-merger levels.

For us, this is HDFC Bank 2.0 that has to be seen differently, and comparing with the past in terms of metrics would not be the right way. The merger has presented the Bank with a massive opportunity which we’re working to seize. India is today in the midst of unprecedented urbanisation, fuelled by rising incomes and aspirations cutting across metros and beyond. The real estate sector is expected to reach a market size of US$1 trillion by 2030, a significant increase from US$ 200 billion in 2021, contributing 13 per cent to the country’s GDP by 2025. The merger has opened up fresh vistas for growth through the mortgage business, not only through increase in home loan disbursals, but also by leveraging customer engagement with the cross-sell opportunities across the HDFC Bank Group. Your Bank has exhibited robust and consistent double-digit, year-on- year growth across its Home Loan business for the first nine months, post the merger. On a sequential basis too, it has gained a leading position recording a growth of 4 per cent. Pre-merger approximately 30 to 35 per cent of incremental home loan disbursals were to customers with an HDFC Bank savings account. This has now touched approximately 85 per cent of incremental disbursals in a space of just nine months. This has been possible due to the extensive distribution network of the Bank, seamless integration of bundled journeys and the execution capability of our teams on the ground, which I am really proud of. Our ability to build a strong liability franchise leveraging home loan customers is well on its way to fruition. Our home loan customers also enjoy the benefit of a strong suite of financial products and solutions that the Bank can offer, like credit cards, consumer durable loans, wealth products, and insurance. This approach helps strengthen customer relationship and enables HDFC Bank emerge as the primary banker for these customers.

While we remain committed to an open architecture model, we do expect to distribute more of the subsidiaries investment and insurance products, leading to an increase in fee income. We continue to spearhead several digital initiatives to enhance customer convenience and expedite the home loan process. Leveraging technology, these initiatives aim to streamline the process and ensure faster turnaround times. All in all, the task of bringing together the leadership teams, technology infrastructures, and cultures of the two entities has been successful, allowing us to pursue our organisation goals as one team. Our Performance Your Bank grew in the last financial year while continuing to demonstrate its traditional balance sheet resilience. The figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited, which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence the comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at in light of the same. On a standalone basis the Profit After Tax (PAT) for the year ended March 31, 2024 was H60,812.3 crore, up by 37.9 per cent over the year ended March 31, 2023. Net Interest Income (NII) for the year ended March 31, 2024 was H1,08, 532 crore up 25.0 per cent over the year ended March 31, 2023. The figure crossed the Rupee one trillion 2 2 mark for the first time in the Bank’s history. Core Net Interest Margin stood at 3.53 per cent and Gross NPAs at 1.24 per cent.

The figure crossed the Rupee one trillion 2 2 mark for the first time in the Bank’s history. Core Net Interest Margin stood at 3.53 per cent and Gross NPAs at 1.24 per cent. There has been a lot of discussion around our Net Interest Margin (NIM) and credit to deposit ratio post our merger as well as the path we would pursue, given the scale of deposit mobilisation required for our growth needs. Post the merger, we are looking at a very different liability profile. We are clear in our intent of pursuing profitable growth. The Bank will continue to focus on granular deposit mobilisation leveraging our inherent distribution strengths and the execution focus that we are known for. It is our endeavour to bring down the credit to deposit ratio to pre-merger levels and our focus would be to maintain adequate liquidity buffers, repayment of eHDFC borrowings as and when they mature, including weighing any prepayment opportunities that may arise, and pursuing profitable sources of lending. During this time of adjustment, the Bank would grow its advances a little slower than the deposit growth. We will avoid pursuing growth which does not meet our risk adjusted profitability thresholds, in line with the Bank’s philosophy. Technology Update I have been consistently sharing updates with you on my key focus areas - improving technology resilience, building for the future, and the three Cs: Culture, Conscience, and Customer. Let me now elaborate on these. Technology has become the cornerstone of modern banking, driving innovation, security, efficiency, and new customer experiences. The Bank embraces technology's evolution into a growth catalyst through the ‘Shift Right’ strategy. Our vision is to shift from a product-centric approach to a customer-centric one through five transformation pillars built on modern technology constructs. With Journeys being a key enabler, the Bank now has over 30 acquisition journeys and 15 servicing journeys, including exciting launches such as FD booking, gold loan top-ups, and innovative home loan cross-sell offerings. Today, more than three- quarters of our acquisitions are digitally driven, with straight-through processing leading to paperless experiences. Our state-of-the-art commercial loan origination engine facilitates in-principle approvals for customers within 30 minutes.

With Journeys being a key enabler, the Bank now has over 30 acquisition journeys and 15 servicing journeys, including exciting launches such as FD booking, gold loan top-ups, and innovative home loan cross-sell offerings. Today, more than three- quarters of our acquisitions are digitally driven, with straight-through processing leading to paperless experiences. Our state-of-the-art commercial loan origination engine facilitates in-principle approvals for customers within 30 minutes. We are taking significant steps to transform our digital Channels into holistic platforms. Our indigenous mobile and net banking platforms are set to introduce a host of new experiences. In the past year, many of our platforms have gained significant traction. For instance, SmartWealth already has over 1,00,000 customers and Chat Banking through WhatsApp is the preferred channel with over 90 lakh monthly interactions. On PayZapp, we now have more than 75 lakh registered customers leveraging innovative features such as Tap to Pay and Swipe to Pay, whereas SmartHub Vyapar now has over 16 lakh merchants. With our dedicated API Factory, we seek to build upon Banking as a Service (BaaS) capabilities, witnessing rapid adoption by large and medium corporates, thus expanding our footprint. CBX, our corporate banking platform, has now HDFC Bank Limited scaled up to over 1,30,000 customers with more than 2 crore transactions in the previous month. Core banking systems are being reinforced with further progress in our 'Hollow the Core' strategy towards modernised engineering for improved resilience and scale. We have also scaled up key systems to accommodate the further expansion of our branches and are increasing our hardware and infrastructure capacity by upgrading to a next-gen core platform. Additionally, we have deployed new platforms in retail assets and microfinance for increased resilience. We introduced a digital-only platform for credit cards, enabling us to launch PIXEL cards. In summary, we are reinforcing our core platforms across retail business landscape. With Data as the focal point of our strategy, we have made substantial progress in our Data Lake initiative for improved data governance and quality. This will pave the way for a holistic reengineering of our enterprise customer database, furthering the ‘Hollow the Core’ strategy.

This year saw the explosion of GenAI as a key, once-in-a-generation technology capability; and your Bank has been actively exploring use cases that could eventually prove instrumental in revolutionising areas like image recognition, language translation and statement analysis. We are also mindful of adopting these technologies within regulatory and security guardrails in a calibrated manner. Having a stronger commitment than ever to Security, we have further bolstered our posture through frameworks such as Zero Trust Architecture for strengthened security and multi-layered defence mechanisms. Our Cyber Security Operations Center is now powered by an advanced AI/ML based platform, which can detect attack patterns with high accuracy. We are also advancing to adopt security engineering practices natively in our software engineering and development lifecycles. I am proud to share that technology played a crucial role in ensuring a seamless merger despite substantial complexities. Integrating over 100 applications through data migration and a multitude of backend system changes, the activity was fully managed and executed by in-house teams imbibing us with further confidence in our capabilities. Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities that come our way as we continue our journey towards becoming a future-ready digital bank. Our commitment to delivering exceptional experiences and inclusive banking services will be driven by the adoption of new-age technologies focusing on scalability, resilience and security while building the bank for the future. Cyber Security At HDFC Bank, cybersecurity and data privacy best practices are important priorities. The Bank remains committed to maintaining a secure cybersecurity posture to protect its technology, confidential information, data integrity, and business continuity. Our strong information security programme, security policies and processes are aligned with various information security management frameworks in the industry and provide necessary assurance on protecting the Bank’s critical information.

It is an ongoing battle which requires continuous investment as the threat landscape is constantly evolving. Our deepest anguish is the threat landscape our customers face leading to compromise of their credentials and a financial loss. The Bank has invested in technology using AI and ML to arrest attempts at customers falling prey to scams and fraudsters. We urge customers to continue to be vigilant and follow safe banking practices, not allowing socially engineered fraud to succeed. The Bank has regularly been running Secure Banking campaigns through social media, SMS, Emails, ATMs, Bank website and various other channels. Your Bank’s Vigil Aunty campaign covering the various modus-operandi of fraudsters is one such example of awareness building. Further, we continue to collaborate with law enforcement agencies, regulatory authorities and peer banks to educate customers on safe banking practices. Customer Centricity My biggest priorities remain deep customer engagement and strengthening a Service First culture. Our implementation of Net Promoter System (NPS), branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’ programme has been one of the largest implementations in the world. This programme provides us with immediate and continuous customer feedback for us to listen, learn and act on the feedback, 2 3 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24OverviewIntroductionOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessStatutory Reports and Financial Statements M E S S A G E F R O M T H E M D & C E O across our entire suite of products and services. We have a robust governance framework in place to continuously listen to this feedback and take appropriate action. I am glad to report that compared to the last financial year we have an eight percentage points improvement in our NPS score. To further improve the Service First culture, we have instituted two key initiatives this year along with increasing the weightage of service in the performance measurement framework across all levels in the organisation. The first one is a structured intervention centre framework to continuously monitor our customer experience delivery across the customer life cycle. The response from our colleagues has been tremendous for this framework. We are seeing good improvements in getting the customer experience delivery right the first time as well"}

The response from our colleagues has been tremendous for this framework. We are seeing good improvements in getting the customer experience delivery right the first time as well as achieving faster turnaround times. The digitalisation of many of our service and acquisition journeys is also being increasingly adopted, both by employees and customers, resulting in further improvements. The second one is highly monitored coaching of our front end colleagues for deeper customer engagement. Whilst the initiatives have yielded results, we have a long way to go to reach a new orbit in Service First culture. People I am proud to share with you the progress that we have made in our quest to be a more inclusive organisation. The year marked several milestones in this journey, an important one being our meeting and exceeding the threshold we had set for ourselves - that 25 per cent of our 2 4 workforce should comprise women by 2025. Women representation in our workforce currently exceeds 55,000 employees and has crossed 26 per cent. of an AI based learning experience platform for employees which enjoyed an adoption rate of 86 per cent in the first 30 days, getting off to a promising start. The Bank, like the rest of the BFSI sector, has experienced a volatile talent landscape in recent times. Attrition was a matter of concern for the Bank as it was for the industry in Financial Year 2022-23. However, in Financial year 2023-24, most of the industry has seen a slight moderation in the attrition rate and that is reflected in our numbers too. Nevertheless, in Financial Year 2023-24 the Bank has taken several efforts to arrest attrition, including setting up a task force at the highest level to identify the controllable causes and taking corrective action. Managers are the primary custodians of talent, and much effort has been made to raise awareness and accountability towards retention and engagement of their teams.

Your Bank has invested in improving employee experience across various touch points along the employee lifecycle. This includes an enhanced onboarding experience, curated customised professional learning through Mpower (our learning experience platform) and an active listening framework, to stay connected with the pulse on the ground. As a result, in Financial Year 2023-24, we saw a drop in new joiner attrition by 10 per cent over last year and the overall attrition drop by over 7 per cent. Your Bank continues to invest in upskilling its talent base of over 2,00,000 employees. Employees are actively leveraging learning on a wide range of skills as well as emerging technologies, clocking over 65 lakh learning hours in Financial Year 2023- 24. The year saw the introduction Over the last few years, we have institutionalised Nurture, Care and Collaborate as a Managerial Behavioural Architecture. This has impacted the overall culture and employee experience as evidenced in the progressive positive shift in the employee sentiment scores over the last four years (75 per cent in Financial Year 2019-20 to 86 per cent in Financial Year 2023-24). Having said that, there is still much to be done and we are earnestly working on it to make this institution an even better place to work for. The year gone by has been especially memorable for the Bank because we welcomed our colleagues from erstwhile HDFC Limited into the Bank’s fold. The amalgamation was a smooth one given that the culture and values of the organisations were aligned. We have always held that the talent, commitment and passion of our people is the bedrock of our success and investing in this talent pool can only add to a service first culture and good customer experience. Getting The Organisation Future Ready In 2021, the Bank announced Project Future Ready and we continue to make considerable progress in this.

These were to be driven by our delivery channels HDFC Bank Limited of Branch Banking, TeleSales/Service/ Relationship and Digital Marketing backed by our technology and digital platforms. The addition of home loans to the Bank’s portfolio adds a new dimension to the strategy especially the retail business. To report on the past year, our Gross Advances (ex-merger) grew by 17.3 per cent and Deposits (ex-merger) grew by 18.4 per cent. An important word on Branch Banking. The Bank added over 900 branches in the year under review and will continue to add more in the current financial year. More than half our branches are in the semi urban and rural areas where a physical presence is often a necessity although the majority of the transactions are digital in nature. These phygital branches are our investments. They will undoubtedly help garner deposits in the future, but it is the older branches that will act as current engines of deposit mobilisation. Our experience clearly reveals that there is an exponential growth in deposit base as the branches age. Our past experience indicates that deposit mobilisation has a strong correlation to the vintage of the branch. The investment in new branches is to ensure that we do not lose out on opportunities for the future while the existing branches continue to drive deposit growth. Environmental, Social and Governance The significance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters can hardly be understated and we are fully conscious of the need for increased Board engagement on strategies that shape the Bank’s future pathways. Your Bank not only remains steadfast in its commitment to transparency in reporting on both, financial and non-financial parameters, but is now moving beyond this. While globally ESG frameworks are still evolving, our ESG disclosures are increasingly going through a similar rigour as financial parameters - especially with the mandating of assurance on certain ESG attributes.

While globally ESG frameworks are still evolving, our ESG disclosures are increasingly going through a similar rigour as financial parameters - especially with the mandating of assurance on certain ESG attributes. The year under review marked the issuance of our first sustainable bond in the international markets which was well received. On the lending side, we continue to integrate environmental and social due diligence as an integral part of our overall credit assessments. ESG considerations also have dependencies on the overall global macro and geopolitical environment, pace of policy and regulatory reforms and technology breakthroughs, especially pertaining to the transition to cleaner energy pathways. As the Bank navigates through the evidently growing climate-related financial risks and other unknown risks, we recognise the importance of a fortified and resilient balance sheet and the need to build buffers from a position of strength, so as to safeguard against future unforeseen shocks and stress scenarios. Through our CSR initiatives under ‘Parivartan’ we have impacted the lives of over 10 crore people. From upskilling farmers on scientific cropping patterns, providing placement linked training and mentoring of entrepreneurs, to supporting start-ups through incubators our consistent efforts have been to create an inclusive society. Providing livelihood opportunities remains at the core of all our initiatives. In Financial Year 2023-24, the Bank has met its CSR obligations. Your Bank has executed its CSR commitments through 210+ partnerships and over 260 projects across 28 states and 8 union territories. Conclusion We began the second quarter of the last financial year with the merger. As we concluded the year, we saw merger synergies starting to play out. This fills us with optimism for the current financial year and beyond. Especially given the anticipated growth in the Indian economy. We will continue to pursue profitable growth without sacrificing asset quality. Looking to the future, I’m confident that with the immensely talented and dedicated team at HDFC Bank, we will continue to innovate, drive sustainable growth, and make a positive impact on the communities we serve.

In FY24, we reviewed our materiality assessment to comply with the latest GRI Universal Standards 2021 and integrate the concept of double materiality. 3 8 HDFC Bank Limited MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS We began by reviewing the 16 sustainability topics included in our FY23 materiality assessment, identified as a result of internal and external stakeholder engagements, data analysis, regulatory compliance and industry benchmarking. This multi-faceted approach led to the final ranking of the 14 sustainability issues into a materiality matrix. The final analysis was presented to the Board of Directors. Identification of Material Topics In FY23, we prioritised our material topics by consolidating stakeholder survey responses. In the first stage, the responses within each group were consolidated to derive the priorities for the respective groups. Next, the responses across different aspects were consolidated by assigning weights to each stakeholder group. The collective scores were then used to prioritise the topics as \"Most important\", \"Important\" and \"Less important\" (considering the reach of impacts within our value chain, magnitude of the impact, and likelihood of occurrence). Materiality Matrix Sign off Weighted Prioritisation Integration into Risk Management Framework Evaluation of potential positive and negative impacts and reprioritisation of results As part of our risk assessment process, we have mapped the identified material topics against the risk categories which are a part of our risk management framework. Of the 14 material topics, 9 have been identified as areas with opportunity and the remaining 5 have the potential to pose risk to our business. Drawing from the results of FY23, we further conducted a thorough analysis for assessing the economic, environmental and social impacts (positive and/or negative) associated with each topic.

Through the effective use of processes, information, and technology, we have developed a multi-layered risk management strategy that identifies, assesses, monitors, and manages risks (credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and operational risk). Our framework incorporates a Board-approved Stress Testing Policy & System, a vital component of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). Stress testing plays a vital role in this assessment by simulating a variety of stressful, yet realistic scenarios to assess our vulnerability to extreme conditions. Description of Impact (Risk: Reputational Risk Impact: Negative, Potential, Within and Outside the Bank) Effective risk management is crucial to safeguard our financial health and prevent systemic instability. As a result, our multi-layered risk management strategy actively identifies, assesses, and reports the risks inherent to our business operations to the appropriate levels of management so that risk mitigation actions can be implemented. Furthermore, we recognise the growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Our ESG & Climate Change Assessment framework helps us identify and mitigate potential ESG risks and climate change threats associated with our borrowers and their business operations. Our independent risk management function ensures objectivity and oversight. A robust risk assessment helps us evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of each risk.

The large, existing customer base of over 9 crore provides a fertile ground for future growth. We would continue to provide products and offer solutions for customers’ needs based on our rich understanding of their profile.

The way forward for us is to continue to offer loans seamlessly across geographies, expanding our reach in Semi-Urban and Rural markets for deeper penetration and maintain our leadership in urban areas and cities. Home Loans The merger of the erstwhile HDFC Limited with HDFC Bank has been transformational for the Bank. It has now emerged as a Bank with one of the largest home loan portfolios in the country. A trusted home loan product is now riding on HDFC Bank’s network of over 8,700 branches, digital touchpoints, complete product range and superior technology. This synergy has enabled us to offer best-in-class home loan offerings to existing and new customers. Post- merger turnaround time has improved significantly. This coupled with the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s strength of connecting with customers in person is a potential game changer in terms of both sales’ turnover and cross- sell. The Bank is in the process of converting erstwhile HDFC Limited’s service centres to branches in a phased manner. As a part of enhancing the cross-sell strategy, home loan customers are now able to avail of a wide range of products/ services like Deposits, Consumer Durable Loans, Credit Cards, Wealth Advisory Products, Unsecured Loans and other retail loans. Savings Accounts for New to Bank customers has moved to about 85 per cent from 35 per cent. This sets the foundation for a stronger connect with incremental customers. In addition to this, our strategy is to improve the focus on the self- employed category which will further increase opportunity in this segment. Post-merger, the Bank has launched and expanded its product basket through banking surrogate programmes as well as leveraging its knowledge for better assessment of such profiles for home loans.

With differentiated strengths and despite having a larger book than peers, the Bank’s model is generating huge benefits on a monthly basis without compromising on its underwriting standards and is expected to generate substantial value for both customers and the Bank in the future. The gross retail mortgages stood at H7,72,786 crore, compared to the previous year's H1,78,840 crore. The figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited which HDFC Bank Limited amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at in light of the same. The Bank believes that the fundamental demand for housing will continue to be strong in the long run in India due to a favourable environment. India is expected to have the largest working population by 2050, which is likely to give a major fillip to urbanisation in the country. Eight crore families are likely to move from rural areas to cities in the country, increasing the need for housing. This is clearly an opportunity for the industry and HDFC Bank is well positioned to help fulfill the housing dreams of millions. The Bank is committed to offering home loan solutions to diverse income categories. Going forward, our aim is to retain and built on our strengths to offer a best-in-class service and capitalise on the immense opportunities that are available in the country.

Both the banking system and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) exhibit stability. Buoyed by healthy capital ratios, improved asset quality and consistent earnings growth, the sector is positioned for robust expansion. Nevertheless, the global landscape remains dynamic with major Central Banks closely monitoring inflation and economic indicators. Qualitative factors such as enhanced disclosures, robust codes of conduct and transparent governance structures remain pivotal for ensuring stability and trust in the financial sector. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has prioritised initiatives to foster inclusion and innovation within the sector in recent years.

The International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast by 10 basis points to 3.2 per cent for 2024. It is expected that emerging and developing economies will experience a growth rate of 4.2 per cent in 2024, which is largely consistent with the 4.3 per cent growth recorded in 2023. Conversely, advanced economies are projected to witness a slight uptick in growth estimated at 1.7 per cent in 2024 compared to 1.6 per cent in 2023. Certain Central Banks in advanced economies are expected to maintain higher policy rates for an extended period due to elevated inflation readings. Additionally, a surge in commodity prices including crude oil and disruptions in the supply chain amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East may impede progress in disinflation and present challenges for Central Banks. India is poised to maintain its position as one of the fastest-growing economies globally in the Financial Year 2024-25.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) anticipates GDP to grow by 7.2 per cent in FY25, compared to 8.2 per cent in FY24. Economic momentum is expected to receive a boost from a further uptick in private capital expenditure and ongoing Government capital outlays. Additionally, the stronger-than- anticipated global growth outlook augurs well for India's economic growth. Moreover, domestic consumer spending is expected to rebound especially in rural areas supported by a normal monsoon, stable inflation, and a reduction in interest rates. Domestic inflation is projected to average 4.6 per cent in FY25, assuming a normal monsoon, compared to 5.4 per cent in FY24. A favourable base effect and subdued core inflation (excluding food and fuel) are anticipated to lend support. OUR RESPONSE HDFC Bank has a robust risk management framework that helps maintain stability and resilience in its operations. It regularly conducts topical stress tests to assess the potential impact of geopolitical, macroeconomic and sectoral trends. The Bank continuously adapts its strategies and actions to enhance its ability to withstand potential challenges.

This transformation has brought forth not only numerous opportunities but also formidable challenges particularly in the realms of cybersecurity and data privacy. The landscape of cyber threats has undergone rapid and complex changes fuelled by targeted attacks, the proliferation of Ransomware-as-a- Service (RaaS) incidents, the utilisation of AI/ML to orchestrate sophisticated attacks as well as the prevalence of DDoS attacks and coordinated group cyber assaults. The repercussions of cyberattacks are profound, impacting not only financial institutions' bottom lines but also their brand reputation and customer trust. Moreover, these incidents often result in attrition and significant financial losses. As the banking sector increasingly adopts cloud-enabled services as part of IT modernisation initiatives and digital-first business strategies, concerns regarding related threats have intensified. Recognising securing the cloud entails a shared responsibility, organisations are actively implementing robust measures to safeguard their cloud infrastructure. Regulators in India are also actively taking measures to ensure data privacy. This is evident through the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, emphasising the nation's commitment to safeguarding data privacy rights. OUR RESPONSE At HDFC Bank, we are committed to robust cyber security and data privacy as part of our technology transformation journey. Key initiatives include the establishment of a next- generation Cyber Security Operations Center, Advanced Security Incident and Event Management solutions augmented by AI and ML capabilities, 24/7 defacement monitoring and a zero-trust architecture approach. In addition, we also have a data privacy program which is led by the Data Privacy Officer and overseen by the Board and Chief Data Officer ensuring stringent compliance with relevant regulations. 7 0 HDFC Bank Limited Growing Emphasis on Sustainable Financing and Climate Risk Management The escalating impact of climate- related events has prompted a heightened emphasis on resilience across sectors with the financial sector playing a pivotal role in mobilising resources for green activities.

Climate change and transition finance have become central to global discourse. In addition, integrating climate and ESG related risks in underwriting policies and risk management framework is becoming increasingly important for financial services companies. The increasing threat of climate change and its physical damage are significant concerns that may impact portfolio performance. Shifting market perceptions and increasing demand for environmentally friendly products and services also have an impact on the cashflows of portfolio companies as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. Effective risk management is essential to manage and mitigate these impacts. Moreover, inadequate information about climate-related financial risks can lead to mispricing of assets and misallocation of capital emphasising the need for a better, more consistent and comparable disclosures. Globally, the publication of IFRS Sustainability Standards in June 2023 is a step in this direction. Aligned with global trends, SEBI introduced mandatory reporting of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for top 1,000 listed entities in India in May 2021. SEBI also mandated assurance on select metrics in the BRSR to further enhance the quality and comparability of ESG Disclosures. Additionally, RBI's draft disclosure framework on Climate-related Financial Risks in February 2024 focuses specifically on disclosures related to governance systems, risk management policies, and the strategies and targets developed by financial services entities to manage climate-related risks. OUR RESPONSE The Bank has conducted internal exercises to evaluate physical and transition risks arising from climate change. The Bank has developed initiatives to manage climate-related risks at the project, portfolio, and organisational levels. Further details on these initiatives can be found in the 'climate related disclosures' section of the report. Additionally, we actively monitor and externally verify the carbon emissions resulting from the Bank’s operations to manage and reduce our environmental impact. We also comply with all relevant regulations including those related to the BRSR, mandated by SEBI. 7 1 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24OverviewIntroductionOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessStatutory Reports and Financial Statements E X T E R N A L E N V I R O N M E N T Regulatory Changes and Government Initiatives The Government of India has made significant strides in promoting financial inclusion through the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).

Risk Frameworks and Their Implementation Given the nature of our business and the regulatory landscape, we are exposed to a spectrum of risks. Among our principal risks are credit, market, liquidity, operational, cybersecurity, and technology risks. Moreover, our operations encompass compliance and reputation risks and ESG-related risks. To manage these, we've instituted an overarching risk appetite framework. We have implemented specific policies, limits, and triggers tailored to each risk category to operationalise our risk appetite for individual risk types. Furthermore, we've undertaken thorough measures to ensure proper measurement and management of risks inherent in the activities integrated through the merger within our framework. Our structured management framework, the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), is designed to identify, assess, and manage all risks that could significantly affect our business, financial position, or capital adequacy. It helps us systematically analyse and address these risks to ensure the stability and soundness of our operations, protecting our business and capital adequacy from potential threats. Ensuring informed decision-making, we regularly capture and report risk exposures, initiating appropriate mitigation measures. Additionally, we continuously refine our risk models to adapt to changing circumstances. To ensure independent evaluation, the Bank has an independent Internal Audit Department for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of all internal controls, risk management practices, governance systems, and processes. We are intensifying our attention on non-financial risks by amplifying discussions within our Risk Management and Board committees.

Financial Institutions have an essential role to play in addressing sustainability challenges, facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and stimulating sustainable development. There are increasing expectations for Banks to embrace sustainable practices from the perspective of borrower credit evaluation, making this a key focus area for regulators, investors, and other stakeholders. Moreover, financial products with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) elements, such as green bonds and social bonds are being curated to satisfy the increasing demand for sustainable investment options. Additionally, Banks are also increasingly incorporating ESG considerations into their risk management practices, including climate scenario analysis and climate- related stress testing.

In response to the growing focus on climate change and ESG factors, regulatory bodies across many jurisdictions are also implementing stricter disclosure requirements. 8 8 HDFC Bank Limited India's Green Push India is increasingly recognising the urgency of addressing climate change and the necessity for innovative financial mechanisms to support sustainable green initiatives. Projections from the Reserve Bank of India indicate a need for over H85 trillion by 2030 to align industries with climate regulations. Recent policy measures aimed at promoting green finance highlight India's proactive efforts in this direction. One notable advancement is the Government of India making its debut in the sovereign green bond space, issuing sovereign green bonds worth H16,000 Crore in FY23 and further increasing it to H20,000 Crore in FY24. Aligning with these trends, a jump in ESG investments by venture capitalists has been observed, signifying a growing interest in sustainable financing. Taking this forward, Banks and other lending institutions are also working to evolve their strategies to actively supporting clients' sustainability goals, streamlining green financing processes, and encouraging businesses towards a low-carbon future. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has accelerated ESG transition by mandating reasonable assurance on quantifiable metrics for the nine principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct for the top 150 companies starting in FY24 which shall be gradually extended to the top 1,000 listed entities by FY27. Building on a decade of promoting sustainable development in banking, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also intensified its focus on climate-related issues in the past years, demonstrated through release of a discussion paper, \"Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance,\" in July 2022, and more recently through release of draft guidelines on climate-related financial disclosures in February 2024.

Our ESG Strategy The evolving landscape of ESG integration in the Banking sector necessitates a holistic approach that encompasses ESG aligned decision-making not only for our internal operational practices, but also extending beyond onto our external financing activities. At HDFC Bank, we are committed to aligning our strategy with global benchmarks. Our previously established Social & Environment Monitoring System (SEMS) Framework for credit risk assessment for financing large industrial/infrastructure projects has now been replaced by a detailed “ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework”. This framework operates under the auspices of our “ESG Risk Management Policy”, for integration of borrower’s current ESG stance and climate transition plans in our credit appraisal process. As we progress, we are also engaging with our wholesale borrowers to understand their current ESG strategy and long- term climate transition plans, with a view to tailor our corporate loan portfolio towards climate-sensitive financing. To strengthen our strategy for climate risk assessments and tracking financed emissions, we are proactively aligning our sustainability and climate reporting frameworks to increasingly integrate best practices and comply with the extant regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This keeps us abreast of the latest developments and practices in climate-related risk management, and serves as guidance to reshape our business model and operations across different geographies. In managing our internal operational practices, capturing ESG performance data remains one of our top priorities, albeit a significant challenge. This challenge stems from the distributed nature of our operations and is compounded by the diverse formats for data recording and the sheer volume of data to be recorded. We continuously engage with stakeholders to communicate ESG requirements and refine our data collection processes to progressively enhance data completeness and accuracy to better align with various reporting frameworks and formats such as the BRSR, GRI, IR, etc., while obtaining external assurance for key ESG performance metrics. Three years ago, we made a strategic commitment to achieve carbon neutrality on our own operations by FY32. We have, since developed and implemented a framework to guide us towards this goal amidst our expanding operations.

As the next step, long-term targets to strive to contribute to a more sustainable future are being set. ESG Integration in Products We have adopted a robust five- dimensional approach for steadily incorporating ESG factors into the design, development, and management of our products with the aforementioned “Environmental Social Governance Risk Management Policy”. This integration is guided by our board approved ESG Risk Management Policy that overlooks assessment, management and monitoring of material ESG risks in our lending portfolio in line with global ESG / Climate Change assessment standards and practices. “ESG Risk Management” framework, is a part of the overall credit assessment process for our wholesale corporate borrowers and has replaced the erstwhile “SEMS Framework”.

For large project financing transactions, particularly those that are specialised and long-term, we conduct additional due diligence beyond the standard borrower-level assessment carried out in all Credit Approval Memorandums (CAMs). This involves the engagement of a Lenders' Independent Engineer (LIE) who evaluates various environmental and social aspects pertinent to the transaction. The LIE Report encapsulates identified risks along with suggested mitigation measures. Pre-disbursement compliance mandates the implementation of these measures, which are then continuously monitored throughout the project's implementation phase. Should any adverse developments arise, corrective action is promptly taken. Under the revised framework, the assessment of ESG and climate change risks is also conducted basis borrower's overall ESG performance and climate change risks in relation to our total loan portfolio. This applies when our aggregate credit appetite surpasses a certain threshold, instead of evaluating each loan individually. The primary objective of this assessment is to evaluate the borrower's current position regarding ESG and climate change considerations so that we can analyze their transition plans and initiatives for mitigating risks associated with these factors.

Client Engagement As the largest private sector Indian Bank, our role is to create awareness amongst our borrowers, thereby encouraging them to measure and disclose their footprint. This would eventually reflect in our Scope 3 emissions and help us move towards a net-zero portfolio commitment. As a part of the regular credit monitoring process, Credit and Relationship teams regularly engage with customers to assess the operational and financial performance of the Borrower. Through this assessment, relevant issues on the environmental & social front are discussed. The impact of climate change on the borrower’s operations are also covered. We understand that there are opportunities in transitioning to a net- zero economy, but the ecosystem (in the country) needs to be developed to take up such opportunities. The Bank has been engaging with its large corporate customers specifically those with businesses in “hard to abate” industries. The purpose of these engagements is to identify current ESG & Climate change related focus areas/practices and to identify best practices and emerging initiatives being taken by industry players on ESG and climate risk related issues including, but not limited to: • Short term emission reduction targets and long-term net-zero goals • Practices with respect to hazardous/ polluting waste management • ESG & climate related disclosures • Supply chain decarbonisation 9 3 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24OverviewIntroductionOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessStatutory Reports and Financial Statements E S G S T R A T E G Y E N C O M P A S S I N G S U S T A I N A B L E F I N A N C E • Policies and practices with respect to gender diversity/inclusion The Bank has been sharing such best practices in wider client engagements with other borrowers in the same segments.

Sustainable Finance Framework Our commitment to enhancing our portfolio from a climate and ESG perspective is reflected in the development of our Sustainable Financing Criteria Framework (“the Framework”). This Board approved framework, is intended to issue green, social and sustainability bonds, originate loans, and use the proceeds to finance or refinance projects that are expected to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and advance socio-economic development in India. 9 4 The framework aligns with the overall sustainability strategy of the Bank and is robust, transparent, and harmonised with the four core components of the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021 (SBG), Green Bond Principles 2021 (GBP), Social Bond Principles 2021 (SBP), Green Loan Principles 2023 (GLP), and Social Loan Principles 2023 (SLP). It aims to identify facilities within our credit portfolio where financing has been provided to borrowers in industries meeting sustainable lending criteria, categorising such credit facilities as either \"green\" or \"social\" facilities. Developed with guidance from the Bond Principles by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and Loan Principles by the Loan Market Association (LMA), the Framework establishes eligibility criteria across ten green categories and six social categories. It outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated and managed. We are committed to reporting on allocation and impact of the use of proceeds - including those contributing to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3 ,4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13.

Renewable Energy Financing Managing Our Portfolio Emissions As a progressive financial service company, we embrace our responsibility to incorporate environmental considerations into our investment decisions. Through our investments, we look forward to driving the transition towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy while mitigating the risk of stranded investments. This includes firming up a strategy to integrate environmental risks, including those stemming from climate change, into our underwriting and portfolio screening processes in the long term. Our lending procedures are guided by borrower and market demand, but our credit exposure is well-diversified, with no single industry having a high concentration. As a result, our credit exposure to ecologically/socially sensitive industry sectors has minimal negative consequences Total outstanding loan on fossil fuels (coal and lignite) and their extraction make up to only about 1% of our total loan portfolio.

As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, we are integrating renewable energy sources into our power consumption, including through captive solar panels in certain offices, where feasible. Through the recent merger, our rooftop solar portfolio has expanded. We have now commissioned a total of 25 rooftop solar installations (14 added as a result of the merger), with a total capacity of approximately 720 kWp, resulting in avoidance of 451.83 tCO2e emissions from the provision of 631.05 MWh of electricity to our operating locations during FY24. Moreover, 12 of our offices and branches continue to source their power from renewable sources through In alignment with the regulatory developments and stakeholder expectations, we continuously strive to identify material key performance indicators (KPIs) for reporting our environmental performance. We maintain a vigilant monitoring system for the identified KPIs and for the outcomes of new initiatives across all our operations. These KPIs encompass metrics related to energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water usage, and waste management.

Three years ago, we set a bold goal: achieving carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by FY32. To that end, we have adopted firm-level guidelines for operations and procurement encompassing supply- side and demand-side interventions; and established a carbon neutrality pathway to guide our progress, even as our operations have grown. The recent merger with eHDFC Ltd. presents exciting opportunities for growth, while also necessitating a strategic review of our carbon neutrality strategy. The observed increase in Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions prompts us to adopt a more holistic approach. We will be reviewing our baseline emissions and setting a new, post-merger baseline in alignment with base year recalculation methodologies of the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This comprehensive review and realignment will allow us to continuously adapt and strengthen our efforts. In FY24, we witnessed an increase of 0.20 million tCO2e in Scope 2 emissions despite 3,270.23 MWh of our electricity consumption having renewable energy attributes (generated from solar rooftop and procured through green tariff). This increase can be attributed to several factors including an increase in the number of locations under our operational control on account of merger with eHDFC Limited with effect from July 1, 2023 and our rapidly increasing geographical footprint to serve underbanked regions. Further, as a result of the merger in order to ensure uniformity across our reporting boundary, the Bank used a spend- based approach for estimation of procured electricity.

We are in the advanced stage of formalising the internal standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of waste generated as well as waste avoided. The roles and responsibilities of various functional departments have been defined to improve data governance and management with an aim to minimise waste generation and enhance the share of waste recycled. As the first step towards improved environmental stewardship, we are progressively enhancing the quality and accuracy of our sustainability disclosures.

Generation of plastic waste, hazardous waste, some quantities of paper & e-waste and non-hazardous waste are extrapolated based on actual data collected at select locations and the quantity of waste generated is assumed to be disposed through other disposal operations. We recognise our responsibility and strive to ensure that all these wastes are disposed responsibly. Responsible waste management is critical to minimising our environmental footprint. This includes minimising waste generation, promoting responsible disposal practices, and ensuring proper handling and processing. We achieve this through partnerships with authorised recycling vendors for various waste streams. Furthermore, we are actively expanding our waste tracking program. Through internal consultations and collaboration with vendors, we will progressively track dry waste across more facilities over the next few years. We recycled 109.74 tonnes of e-waste and 20.51 tonnes of batteries n FY24, all handled by authorised recyclers. At some of our locations, used diesel oil is produced due to the operation of gensets which is classified as hazardous waste and disposed using approved, authorised vendors. 1 0 7 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24OverviewIntroductionOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessStatutory Reports and Financial Statements E N V I R O N M E N T Water Conservation Reflecting the nature of our business, our water consumption is primarily for domestic purposes and drinking.

The details of this can be found in our ‘Social- Communities’ chapter. Water Intensity (kl/H Crore Revenue from Operations) FY24 FY23 Notes: 1.57 2.07 Water intensity has been computed based on Total Revenue which includes interest earned and other income, excluding profit/(loss) on sale of buildings & other assets (net) earned under Schedule 14 of the Audited Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank. 5Water withdrawn is estimated based on the document by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), which specifies that an office employee consumes 45 liters per day per head. This amount is recorded as water withdrawn from third party source. Water discharged is considered as 80% of the water withdrawn from source, based on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) database report dated December 24, 2009. Therefore, it is assumed that of the total water withdrawal, only 20% is consumed. The data for FY 22-23 has been aligned using the above approach. 1 0 8 HDFC Bank Limited Climate Risk-related Disclosures In response to the escalating urgency of climate change, various sectors are adapting to new regulatory landscapes to mitigate environmental impacts. The global fight against climate change has led to the advent of regulations like Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This has spurred India to create a regulated carbon market, paving the way for the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), under the Energy Conservation Act. This scheme envisages both, compliance and the development of a voluntary carbon market. Some of the operational guidelines for CCTS are currently work-in-progress.

To navigate this new landscape, organisations need to reassess their climate risks and become more climate transparent. Global guidelines like the IFRS S2 standard, which subsumes the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, present a framework for such disclosures. Recognising the growing concerns of regulators, investors, and clients regarding climate risks, particularly for banks and financial institutions, the Bank has been reporting on governance, risks and opportunities, strategy as well as metrics and emission reduction targets linked to climate change. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued various draft guidelines on such disclosures, the latest one being the Draft Disclosure framework on Climate-related Financial Risks, 2024 published on February 28, 2024. We are continuously striving to align ourselves to make increased climate risk related disclosures. Governance Board Oversight The Board of Directors have increased their oversight on climate- related issues. The CSR and ESG Committee of the Board oversees the Bank’s sustainability and climate change initiatives. This Committee monitors the ESG framework, the Environmental Policy, actionables and initiatives strategised and executed by the management level ESG Apex Council and the ESG Working Groups. The Committee also maintains an oversight over the Bank’s ESG disclosures, highlighting the Bank’s ESG performance and prioritisation of material topics. A dedicated ESG vertical that works in conjunction with several internal and external stakeholders, to drive the Bank’s ESG agenda including managing, mitigating, and reporting on climate metrics. The Deputy Managing Director of the Bank has direct oversight on the ESG function and reports to the Board on such matters.

Specifically, the Bank’s ESGRM Policy addresses climate transition and mitigation plans and includes a prohibition list criterion and ‘Category-A’ tagging of climate risk- related vulnerable sectors. As part of this policy, we use our ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework as a part of the overall credit assessment for certain wholesale borrowers as per the ESGRM Policy. Under this policy, the Credit Appetite Memorandum assesses ESG and climate change risks associated with the borrowers’ operations and mitigation measures/ controls. The framework also captures various aspects of ESG compliance and climate change risks/mitigants in relation to the borrower, and their business operations. Through the framework, risk exposures are identified and reported to management, thus enabling the implementation of necessary risk mitigation actions. The Board-approved Operational Risk Management Policy outlines the governance structure and processes for managing operational risk. This structure consists of three lines of defense: the business line (including support and operations) is the first line, an independent Operational Risk Management Department (ORMD) is the second line, and Internal Audit is the third line. The Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC) of the Board oversees the risk management strategy of the Bank and ultimately reports to the Board of Directors. The Bank had also implemented a Board-approved ESG policy framework, a guiding document for all ESG initiatives and activities undertaken by the Bank, focusing on climate change strategy, environmental and social risk management in lending, procurement practices, workforce and employment practices, good governance, and stakeholder management. We have developed a Sustainable Financing Framework in line with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2021, Social Bond Principles 2023, and Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2021.

Committees Guiding Climate Risk Management We have established a robust governance structure to oversee our ESG approach, comprising the CSR and ESG Committee of the Board borrowers with exposures above a specified threshold as defined in the ESG Risk Management Policy. Further, the Bank has partnered with an independent, reputable global agency to develop a framework for assessing climate transition risk at a counter-party level. The Bank has launched an internal pilot exercise to estimate financed emissions. During FY24, the Board received regular updates on matters such as key government and regulatory policy, regulatory engagement and ESG matters including areas such as progress on our climate strategy, policy updates, industry trends, stakeholder engagement and target- setting. The Board members participate in dedicated familiarisation sessions to enhance their understanding of emerging climate related risks impacting the Bank and the adequacy of actions for management of the identified risks. In FY24, two meetings were conducted for the Board on emerging regulations and best practices related to ESG and climate risk management.

Under the aegis of the Apex Council, three ESG working groups drive the Bank’s ESG agenda. Our Board-level CSR and ESG Committee oversees sustainability and climate change initiatives, and is responsible for monitoring the ESG Policy framework, Environmental Policy, and other climate-related action plans. It ensures that the Bank’s ESG disclosures effectively communicate the Bank’s performance and prioritisation of material topics like climate change. The Committee reviews climate-related plans, targets, performance against those targets, and employee/business unit initiatives to mitigate climate change. Additionally, it allocates annual budgets for ESG initiatives. The CSR and ESG Committee convenes quarterly and discusses and updates on climate change initiatives and guides on further course of action. The Bank has established a separate ESG Apex Council at the management level, that shapes and guides the Bank’s overall ESG strategy and provides actionable recommendations which are further reported quarterly to the Bank’s CSR and ESG Committee. The Council comprises of senior management that governs and reviews the progress of Bank’s ESG strategy and roadmap through three distinct working groups, namely Environment Working Group, Social & Governance Working Group, & Product Responsibility Working Group, and targets climate risk related governance across environment, social, and product dimensions. The Bank’s comprehensive risk management is overseen by the Board of Directors. The RPMC is a Board-level committee that supervises the implementation of the risk strategy, has been formed as per the guidelines of Reserve Bank of India on Asset Liability Management/ Risk Management Systems. The RPMC monitors compliance with risk parameters and aggregate exposures within the appetite set by the Board. It also reviews the enterprise-wide risk frameworks viz.

Training and Capacity Building on ESG and Climate We are committed to fostering a comprehensive understanding of climate change throughout our organisation, ensuring that every function and employee is equipped with functional and role-appropriate knowledge and skills to address its challenges. To achieve this, we implement robust training and capacity-building programs tailored to the diverse needs of our workforce. We have e-learning modules on climate change and GHG emissions, thus instilling a shared understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities across all levels of our organisation. Through these comprehensive training and capacity- building efforts, we empower our employees to become active contributors to our sustainability goals and help develop the Bank's resilience to the challenges posed by climate change. We also conduct targeted capacity-building initiatives focused on ESG and climate change for specific teams, such as our credit and business teams. Our emphasis lies on equipping these teams with the knowledge and tools necessary to integrate climate considerations into their decision-making processes and conduct climate-specific due diligence effectively. 1 1 2 HDFC Bank Limited Strategy At HDFC Bank, we are committed to mitigating risks and leveraging opportunities arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy. We endeavor to build our capability to manage risk from climate change and deliver our regulatory commitments, thereby demonstrating to our investors that the Bank is effectively managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Identifying Climate-related Risks and Opportunities Our strategy is underpinned by the way we assess and manage our exposure to climate-related risk. There are two main types of climate related risks: • Physical Risks: Extreme weather events like floods and cyclones can cause physical damage to property and assets, leading to economic losses (physical damage to property and assets). The Bank is assessing the potential financial impacts of these physical risks on the Bank’s operations. • Transition Risks: The shift towards a low-carbon economy may impact"}

The Bank is assessing the potential financial impacts of these physical risks on the Bank’s operations. • Transition Risks: The shift towards a low-carbon economy may impact the value of certain assets and liabilities including the likelihood of formation of stranded assets. The Bank is exploring opportunities in green financing and sustainable infrastructure projects to mitigate these risks and capitalise on emerging market trends. The Bank has also partnered with an independent, reputable global agency to develop a framework for assessing climate transition risk at a counterparty level. Additionally, we have identified some climate-related risks and opportunities that the banking sector may face over the short, medium, and long term, as well as their corresponding impacts including: Risk Type of risk Description Current regulation Transition risk factor Emerging regulation Transition risk factor Technology Transition risk factor Legal Transition risk factor Market Transition risk factor Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part of current regulations are always integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process. Current regulations are also factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the comprehensive ESG and Climate Change assessment framework for its wholesale corporate borrowers. Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy, technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a low-carbon economy. This is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and certain infrastructure sectors. While our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of our business today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology to have a significant impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use technology to enable business. For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental rules, failing to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the project goes into litigation. This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are no other circumstances in which the Bank can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit. In the"}

We thus invest in community and customer involvement through surveys and structured engagements to educate and enlighten them on climate risks and mitigation. Further, ESG performance measures are increasingly being used by the global investor community, especially sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, to assess long-term profitable growth. We strive to implement environment-friendly measures throughout our operations. We further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate change, by including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the annual report. In addition, in our annual integrated report, we publish details on our carbon emissions and footprint (third-party assured). Acute physical hazards such as cyclones, floods, and water stress can have a negative influence on the credit portfolio by causing bad debts, impairing assets or collaterals due to damage to property, infrastructure, and land, and interrupting operations. This is also relevant for climate disasters destroying assets (that serve as collaterals).

This includes evaluating the potential impact of climate change on the Bank’s lending practices, customer base, and operational costs. The Bank believes that this proactive approach will help navigate the evolving landscape of climate change while seizing opportunities for sustainable growth. The Bank actively reports to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), on its strategy that integrates both the potential risks and opportunities presented by climate change. We understand that climate change provides both risks and potential opportunities for our business. From the perspective of climate risk assessment, we plan on assessing the priority of physical and transition risks in the near to medium term. We have a three-pronged strategy to adapt to climate change: decarbonising our operations; managing climate risk & financed emissions; and financing the transition. Decarbonising Our Operations • Minimising our operational carbon footprint is central to the Bank’s sustainability strategy. • We are committed to effectively managing and mitigating the environmental impacts of our operations by adopting industry best practices and standards."}

Client Engagement As a trusted financial institution, we continue to proactively engage with many of our larger corporate clients on both the risks and opportunities related to their businesses. To enable us to provide the appropriate advice and capital solutions, we also encourage clients to share and enhance their climate disclosures. Through client engagement, our goal is to determine current ESG and climate change focus areas and practices. We strive to identify industry best practices and emerging initiatives on ESG and climate risk issues, including short-term emission reduction targets, long-term net- zero goals, ESG and climate-related disclosures, and supply chain decarbonisation.

Risk Management Risk Identification Effectively managing climate risk requires proactive identification, a thorough understanding of the domain, as well as comprehensive inputs from stakeholders. At the Bank, risk identification is an ongoing process that includes the consideration of climate-related factors such as physical (acute and chronic) and transition risks in the lending portfolio. We are actively seeking opportunities to enhance our capabilities in identifying these risks and their impacts on our business and endeavor to incorporate additional climate risk considerations related to sector, product, and geography, 1 1 6 aligning specific perils and transition categories, linking new and existing risks to other sustainability categories, and identifying the applicable time horizons for impacts. Climate-related Risk Management In line with its sustainability- focused vision and commitments, the Bank has developed several initiatives to manage climate-related risks at the project, portfolio, and organisational levels. Project Risk At a project level, a risk assessment focused on social and environmental aspects is integrated into the Bank’s overall credit approval framework. The Bank’s ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework, under the aegis of our ESG Risk Management Policy (ESGRM), ensures thorough environmental and social due diligence of various loan proposals above the defined credit exposure thresholds, including direct customer loans, wholesale loans, supply chain finance, offshore, and capital market loans, as well as loans to banks, financial institutions, or NBFCs. This assessment helps the Bank evaluate the borrower's current position regarding ESG and climate change considerations and analyze their transition plans and initiatives for mitigating risks associated with these factors.

We aim to: • decarbonise our operations • expand our green and sustainable banking products • enhance the scope and accuracy of our climate scenario analysis and stress testing, applicable for the bank’s lending portfolio. • monitor and estimate our lending portfolio related financed emissions. As disclosure requirements and regulations continue to evolve, we expect to take these into consideration while developing our financial strategy. 1 1 8 Measurement of Financed Emissions: Pilot Study Financed emissions refer to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are associated with lending and investment activities of financial institutions. As per the GHG Protocol, financed emissions are a specific category of indirect, downstream emissions and are classified as Scope 3 emissions. Financed emissions are critical to better understand the role of the financial sector in climate change. However, the lack of reliable and standardised India specific emission factors remains a challenge in measuring financed emissions. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) provides a framework to help financial institutions report their financed emissions. While the PCAF guidance varies across different asset classes, the broad methodology for corporate loans revolves around the concept of determining the financed emissions of a given exposure using the concept of an ‘attribution factor’ and then applying it to the estimated emissions of the underlying company or sub-sector. Further, PCAF guidance is available for only a few asset classes, which poses constraints in determining overall portfolio level emissions. The PCAF methodology ascribes data quality scores from level 1 to 5. Level 1 data is where emission factors of the underlying entity has been verified by an independent third party. Level 2 data entails emissions that are reported by companies but have not been externally verified. Level 3 to 5 data is where emissions are calculated based on production level activity or sectoral /proxy data. On some of our corporate/"}

Level 2 data entails emissions that are reported by companies but have not been externally verified. Level 3 to 5 data is where emissions are calculated based on production level activity or sectoral /proxy data. On some of our corporate/ wholesale loans, it has been our constant endeavor to collect E&S information as per our ESG Risk Management Policy. While we recognise the challenges in collecting data on emissions, we are encouraged that a growing number of our wholesale borrowers are reporting Scope 1 and Scope 2 data. As a Bank, we recognise that we do bear some responsibility for the environmental impacts of projects and entities that we finance. We have on a voluntary basis, commenced the exercise of measuring financed emissions of the bank’s lending portfolio. We are working with a climate tech startup to help in the assessment of measuring financed emissions based on our lending to various industries/sectors. We are testing the efficacy of India specific sectoral emission intensities based on Environmentally Extended Economic Input-Output models. HDFC Bank Limited Based on loans of the previous year, we undertook a pilot study of a sample pool of 2,768 wholesale loans to 309 listed entities disclosing Level 1 or Level 2 data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, across 34 sectors, which included certain hard-to-abate industries. Our reporting of financed emissions followed the PCAF standard for corporate loans as described below: Attribution factor = Outstanding debt/Enterprise Value 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = Σ 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑥 𝐷𝑒𝑏𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (Enterprise value for a listed company is market capitalisation + borrowings) Using the above-mentioned PCAF methodology, the sample pool totalling approximately H1.5 lakh crore had financed emissions of 12.2 million t of CO2e. Although it is acknowledged that the exercise is backward looking, rather than futuristic, it still represents a significant milestone in the Bank’s journey towards measuring and managing its financed emissions. The exercise has enabled the Bank to identify variances based on actual entity-level data of Scope 1 and 2 emissions versus applying sectoral level emission factors. This understanding shall help the Bank to establish more accurate baselines which will serve as the foundation for setting realistic and achievable"}

Organisational Risk Metrics and Targets The Bank’s operations entail compliance and reputation risks, as well as ESG risks. To address these risks, the Bank has established an aggregate Risk Appetite Framework. Furthermore, risk-specific policies, limits and triggers are implemented to operationalise the appetites for individual risk types. The Bank recognises climate risk as a material risk. The Bank has a structured management framework called the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess, and manage all risks that could potentially have a significant negative impact on our business, financial position, or capital adequacy. We have taken on an ambitious target for achieving carbon neutrality of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by FY32 and are already aligning our operations to progressively stringent internal benchmarks for enhancing our energy performance and integration of renewable energy. (Refer GHG emissions section for further details). Additionally, we aspire to fortify our commitment to financing climate change solutions such as energy transition, renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, green buildings, climate smart agriculture, among others, and have already embarked on a process to examine our financed emissions and carbon-related asset exposure with the intent to develop KPIs and track the progress towards assisting our customers in transitioning to a sustainable, lower-carbon economy. 1 1 9 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24OverviewIntroductionOur PerformanceHow We Create ValueOur StrategyResponsible BusinessStatutory Reports and Financial Statements C U S T O M E R C E N T R I C I T Y O U R J O U R N E Y Customers at the Heart of Everything At HDFC Bank, our relentless focus on customer centricity drives us to innovate and deliver exceptional financial solutions.

HDFC Bank has developed a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Policy, Customer Rights Policy, Customer Compensation Policy duly approved by the Board which outlines a framework for resolving customer grievances. These policies are accessible to customers through the Bank’s website and branch network. HDFC Bank has created multiple channels for customers to provide feedback and register grievances facilitating a transparent and accessible system. As a pioneer in innovative financial solutions and digital platforms, it has witnessed an increased utilisation of its digital channels. Keeping customer interest in focus, the Bank has formulated a Board approved Protection Policy which limits the liability of customers in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions. This Bank is compliant with the RBI Internal Ombudsman Guidelines. At the apex level, as a part of the Internal Grievance Redressal Mechanism, the Bank has appointed seasoned-retired bankers as Internal Ombudsmen to independently review any customer grievance which is partly/wholly rejected by the bank before the final decision is communicated to the customer. HDFC Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system. This customer experience transformation programme helps employees to empathise better with customers and improve turnaround times. Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles,’ the programme helps establish behaviours and practices that result in customer-centric actions through continuous improvement in products, services, process and policies. The Bank remains committed to placing the customer at the centre of its operations. By consistently improving customer experience, adopting an omnichannel approach and implementing robust service quality and Grievance Redressal Mechanisms, it aims to build lasting relationships. Building a Customer- Centric Culture using Net Promoter System (NPS) - ‘Infinite Smiles’ We, at the Bank, believe that delivering an outstanding customer experience is a strong differentiator for a great product and is key to a sustained competitive advantage.

This Bank wide campaign offers practical scenarios to illustrate acceptable and unacceptable behaviours. By equipping our workforce with knowledge and guidance they need, we are empowering them to lead the transformation in their area of influence. Culture is the collective behaviour of our 2 lakh plus employees and it has been our endeavour to inspire them at an individual level to participate in this journey. 1 4 0 HDFC Bank Limited Some of the interventions shared below are examples of various communication themes that were used during the year. #Mind your Language NCC Short Films NCC Micro-experiences Evolve 30 second reels were created to explicitly articulate managers’ or colleagues' unacceptable behaviours @HDFC Bank. The reels reiterate the message that HDFC Bank is psychologically a safe place to work, where employees should feel valued, trusted be authentic. NCC short films were conceptualised, scripted and enacted by HDFC Bank employees. The films picturise the negative impact of bad behaviour on team morale and how managers can correct the situation. The films encourage our viewers to adopt NCC principles as a way of life. Evolve aims at building capability of our people managers’ to effectively demonstrate managerial behaviours including holding performance conversations, using appreciative inquiry, bridging the generational gap at work and improving connect with new joiners in their teams. NCC micro-experiences is a communication series to guide employees especially managers in creating instant, realistic and meaningful micro experiences for their teams. The idea is to create a positive environment which will strengthen emotional bonds among team members and build stronger, cohesive teams. These micro experiences focus on the 9 practices of NCC and are shared with all employees on a regular basis."}

Innovation continues to drive efficiency and effectiveness in our talent acquisition function. With the introduction of AI powered hiring the attempt is to make our hiring process fair and unbiased. This has especially helped in our diversity hiring agenda. We take pride in several ‘All Women Branches’ doing exceptionally well on customer service, compliance, performance and all other major parameters. This serves as a testimony to the fact that inclusive organisations perform better in the long run. Many of these branches are situated in deep geographies where they also serve as a lever for social change. Building an inclusive organisation requires continuous effort of recognising and addressing unconscious biases and building support structures. Over the past year, we have focused on identifying high- potential women in junior and middle management and actively guiding their career paths. This includes helping them take on higher-impact roles, equipping them with the necessary skills and competencies and providing visibility of opportunities.

Women Retention and Engagement The Bank has developed various initiatives and supportive policy measures which would enable us to ensure higher women engagement, offer them career growth opportunities, thereby retain women and build the leadership pipeline. Some of our key initiatives include: Pleasant Parenthood Programme Career Accelerator Programme Stay Interviews ‘Stay interviews’ with select women employees across levels have helped us pre-empt support requirements and customise solutions at an individual employee level. The ‘Broken Rung’ is a global phenomenon where diversity ratios across mid and senior levels in organisations drop significantly. This is because life-stage milestones often coincide with career milestones for women. In recognition of this, the Bank had introduced the ‘Pleasant Parenthood Program’ which is a slew of benefits for primary caregivers. This includes flexibility options, rating protection, wellness support and manager guidance. These policy measures are now becoming a ‘Way of life’ in the Bank. The 'Career Accelerator Program' is our flagship initiative designed for mid-senior level women in the Bank. Given its success, we continue to run this program to maintain a robust talent pipeline of women advancing into senior leadership roles. Over 200 high-potential women leaders have been part of the CAP journey across two cycles. Sponsored by the DEI Council, the program focuses on authenticity and self-awareness, building a leadership brand, executive presence, influencing and networking. 1 4 4 HDFC Bank Limited Women who Reported a Positive Workplace Experience Gap between Employee Experience of Men and Women Culture Pulse, 2024 VOICE, 2021 VOICE, 2020 81% 79% 68% Culture Pulse, 2024 5% VOICE, 2021 VOICE, 2020 8% 10% All the above actions have resulted in higher retention rates for women and significant improvement in their engagement scores.

The Task Force has recommended several actions which have been taken up for implementation. 1 4 6 HDFC Bank Limited The various actions undertaken included, but were not limited to, the following: Redesign of New Joiner experience • Defining and measuring the Manager’s role in ensuring smooth assimilation of the young talent • Improving time to productivity by introducing on the job training and various skill-based training and assessments in the zero-day onboarding session • Establishing clear goals and defining early success parameters Holding Managers and Leaders accountable for People metrics with defined success parameters Refining Bank's policies and processes This included streamlining the Onboarding process, robust orientation and learning processes and establishing manager accountability measures Ensuring continuous on-ground support by HR and business leaders All this has resulted in a significant drop of 7 per cent in the attrition rate in FY24 compared to the previous Financial Year. Our effort is to continue to stay focused on minimising early attrition and sustaining the downward trajectory on overall attrition.

The impact assessments considered the OECD-DAC criteria, which is widely regarded as one of the gold standards in evaluation frameworks. This framework assesses the project’s indicators by determining their Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Impact and Sustainability. These criteria provide a normative framework used to determine the merit or worth of an intervention (policy, strategy, programme, project or activity). Other frameworks like the standard Outcome- Impact Framework was also followed to analyse and measure the outcomes and impact of the selected project by tracing the changes since the implementation of the project and establishing the causes of these changes. In FY24, we conducted an impact assessment of 61 projects. Based on the assessment findings, several recommendations were proposed for the evaluated projects to enhance their effectiveness & accessibility, and to strengthen their capacity to scale, deepen and extend the duration of outcomes. We also conducted evaluative SROI studies of two projects within the overarching theme of ‘Skill Development and Livelihood Enhancement’ based on actual outcomes that had already taken place. The evaluation was guided by the seven principles outlined by the SROI Network. The findings and observations from this study shall be used to formulate future course corrective actions and a strategy for scaling up the project.

Currently, a considerable number of our initiatives are being implemented in such areas. Furthermore, we have ensured the coverage of 85 aspirational districts (out of the total of 112) through our CSR programs. The World Bank defines rural development as the improvement in the social and economic environment of the rural population. The fundamental aims of rural development include planning, creating and using resources such as land, water and manpower to promote equal opportunity for the population reliant on them. Given this context, Holistic Rural Development Programme (HRDP) strives to enhance the lives of people in rural communities by primarily bringing about sustainable socio- economic transformation and ecological development. HRDP adopts a comprehensive approach to sustainable development by integrating various interventions, ranging from Natural Resource Management, Education and Livelihood Enhancement & Skill Development to Healthcare.

These efforts aim to enhance the socio- economic conditions of waste pickers in alignment with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2018 and Swachh Bharat Mission. Furthermore, we are institutionalising waste pickers in Swachh Centres (SCs)/MRFs and ULBs for long- term solutions, thereby contributing to sustainable waste management practices. Through our initiatives, we are also generating awareness and mobilising communities for safe plastic disposal, emphasising the importance of responsible waste management for environmental and public health benefits. Under this thematic area of Healthcare and Hygiene, our objective is to enhance the standard of sanitation facilities. Our efforts towards achieving this objective are directed towards three distinct sub-goals, namely waste management, access to clean drinking water and creating hygiene awareness.

Recognising this pressing need, we are committed to addressing financial exclusion by reaching out to the unbanked and under-banked populations in rural, semi-urban and urban areas across the country. As part of this effort, the Bank considers it a responsibility to promote financial awareness, particularly among marginalised sections of society, through various initiatives.

The primary objective of these initiatives is to empower individuals with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions about their finances, thereby enhancing their financial well-being. Dairy Support The dairy support program is instrumental in facilitating a substantial shift in the payment methods of farmers, moving from cash transactions to digital banking. This transition effectively addresses the challenges associated with managing payments in the dairy sector and navigating a farmer in mainstream banking services. Women play a significant role in the dairy sector, contributing to various aspects of production, processing and management. In many states, women are actively involved in milking cows, feeding livestock, and ensuring animal health. This project is vital to rural development & financial inclusion, playing a key role in advancing the progress and sustainability of the rural economy. This project further emphasises the larger CSR objective of Women Empowerment and facilitating their social and economic standard. By fostering credit history and embracing digitisation, this program significantly elevates banking services for dairy farmers. This will also help in promoting healthy savings habits in farmers which is ultimately contributing to financial inclusion for the rural economy. Encouraging regular deposits, setting achievable savings goals and utilising interest-bearing accounts are effective strategies to build savings over time. By educating farmers on the importance of saving and providing access to financial services in rural areas, we can empower communities to secure their financial futures and participate more fully in the economy.

Its performance is an outcome of its disciplined approach to managing risk and return. The Financial Year 2023-24 was a historic one as the merger of parent HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank was completed. This merger strengthened our position as a leading financial conglomerate with marquee financial services institutions like HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited, HDFC Asset Management Company Limited and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Limited becoming subsidiaries in addition to the existing ones, HDFC Securities Limited and HDB Financial Services Limited. Coming to the macroeconomic environment, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in the world in the Financial Year 2024-25 with the RBI expecting GDP growth at 7.2 per cent. The figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence the comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at in light of the same. Based on Standalone Financial Statements The income statement reflected a growth in revenue comprising Net Interest Income and Non Interest Income. While the former grew by 25.0 per cent, the latter grew by 57.7 per cent year- on-year. On an overall basis, Total Net Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024, reached ` 1,57,773.5 crore, reflecting an increase of 33.6 per cent over the previous year. Over the past three years, the Indian economy grew on an average by 8.3 per cent and at 8.2 per cent in FY24. GDP growth has been supported by an increase in capital expenditure with the Government doing the heavy lifting. Inflationary pressures have moderated over the last fiscal year with retail inflation averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per cent in FY23. On the global front, geopolitical tensions could act as a headwind for India’s growth and inflation outlook.

TOTAL CAR 18.8 per cent Well Above Regulatory Minimum Requirement of 11.7 per cent 2 1 9 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Management Discussion and Analysis Macroeconomic and Industry Development Over the past three years, the Indian economy registered an average growth rate of 8.3 per cent. India’s real GDP growth has been pegged at 8.2 per cent for FY24 as per the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital expenditure particularly in infrastructure development including roads, highways, railways and housing with the Government doing the heavy lifting. Additionally, private sector investment also showed some signs of resurgence in sectors such as cement, steel, oil and gas. On the other hand, private consumption growth slowed to 4.0 per cent in FY24 from 6.8 per cent in FY23 and 11.7 per cent in FY22. To recall, post the pandemic, consumption had been driven by services along with high demand for premium products. However, as this pent-up demand effect waned and interest rates started rising consumer demand slowed down in FY24. Moreover, high food inflation and an uneven monsoon weighed on rural demand recovery. As for the supply side, rise in manufacturing and construction activity has largely aided growth. The manufacturing sector has benefitted from improved profit margins due to lower input costs, while Government support schemes such as the ECLGS aided MSMEs. Further, favourable infrastructure and policy measures like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and FAME 2 Schemes finally paid off for some critical sectors like automobiles, electronics (largely mobile handsets) and metals. Moreover, the construction sector has maintained an average growth rate of 13.1 per cent over the past three years supported by Government infrastructure investments and an increased housing market demand. On the external front, slowdown in global growth significantly impacted India’s exports of goods and services in FY24. However, expansion of professional and business services exports combined with diversification"}

Moreover, the construction sector has maintained an average growth rate of 13.1 per cent over the past three years supported by Government infrastructure investments and an increased housing market demand. On the external front, slowdown in global growth significantly impacted India’s exports of goods and services in FY24. However, expansion of professional and business services exports combined with diversification to new markets such as Central Asia and Latin America helped cushion the impact of the slowdown elsewhere in the global economy. Going forward, India is expected to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the World in FY25 with the RBI forecasting a GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent. Economic activity is expected to be supported by a further surge in private capital expenditure and continued Government capital spending. Moreover, a higher allocation for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) sectors in the Budget for FY25 is likely to bolster manufacturing activity and attract FDI flows. In addition, a continued diversification 2 2 0 of supply chains out of China and to other emerging markets is likely to channel investment flows into India. Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast by 10 bps to 3.2 per cent for FY24 which bodes well for India’s economic growth. In addition, domestic consumer spending is expected to see some recovery particularly in rural areas as a normal monsoon, stable inflation and a reduction in interest rates support demand. Inflationary pressures have moderated over the last fiscal year, with retail inflation averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per cent in FY23. Although, retail headline inflation rose to a high of 7.4 per cent in July 2023 it has since moderated reaching 4.83 per cent in April 2024. Encouragingly, core inflation (retail inflation excluding food and fuel) has also dipped below 4 per cent signalling a disinflationary trend. Going forward, we expect retail inflation to average at 4.6 per cent in FY25 assuming normal monsoon. Additionally, a favourable economic base and controlled core inflation is expected to offer support. That said, weather related disturbances such as heatwaves, uneven distribution of monsoons along with a resurgence in global commodity prices remain a risk to the inflation trajectory.

Emerging risks on the global front could pose challenges to India’s growth trajectory and inflation outlook. Higher crude oil prices as a result of any escalation in Middle East tensions and tighter global oil supply pose a risk for domestic growth and inflation. Moreover, the impact of geopolitical tensions on global supply chains could hurt India’s exports to major trading partners and escalate costs. However, while global challenges may pose some risks, the resilience and momentum shown by the domestic economy in recent years suggests it is well- equipped to navigate any potential headwinds.

This surge in disbursement is noteworthy as it marks a significant increase from the average of 1,500 cases per month over the past 8 months, nearly tripling the previous rate. The disbursement primarily focused on small and marginal farmer loans. In Financial Year 2023-24, the Bank has disbursed an amount of ` 8,786 crore to 2,47,533 farmers as Cattle finance. Digital Interventions Some of the digital interventions made by your bank include: Digitising Milk Procurement: This initiative brings transparency in the milk procurement and payment process, which benefits both farmers and dairy societies.

The MFTs link the milk procurement system of the dairy society to the farmer’s account to enable faster payments. MFTs have cash dispensers that function as standard ATMs. Payments are credited without the hassles of cash distribution. Further, this process creates a credit history which can then be used for accessing bank credit. Apart from dairy and cattle loans, customers gain access to the Bank’s products including digital offerings such as 10 Second Personal Loan, Kisan Credit Card and Bill Pay.

HDFC Bank has developed a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Policy, Customer Rights Policy, Customer Compensation Policy, duly approved by the Board, which outline a framework for resolving customer grievances. These policies are accessible to customers through the Bank’s website and branch network. HDFC Bank has created multiple channels for customers to provide feedback and register grievances, facilitating a transparent and accessible system. As a pioneer in innovative financial solutions and digital platforms, it has witnessed an increased utilisation of its digital channels. Keeping customer interest in focus, the Bank has formulated a Board approved Protection Policy which limits the liability of customers in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions. This Bank is compliant with the RBI Internal Ombudsman Guidelines. At the apex level, as a part of the Internal Grievance Redressal mechanism, the Bank has appointed seasoned- retired bankers as Internal Ombudsmen to independently review any customer grievance which is partly/wholly rejected by the Bank before the final decision is communicated to the customer. HDFC Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system.

By consistently improving customer experience, adopting an omnichannel approach and implementing robust service quality and grievance redressal mechanisms, it aims to build lasting relationships. Risk Management and Portfolio Quality Your Bank’s historical focus on Pillar 1 risks including Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk has been expanded in response to the evolving banking landscape. Liquidity Risk, Climate Risk, Information Technology Risk and Information Security Risk have also emerged as critical considerations. These risks not only impact your Bank’s financial strength and operations but also its reputation. To address these concerns, your Bank has established Board-approved risk strategy and policies overseen by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC). The Committee ensures that frameworks are established for assessing and managing various risks faced by your Bank, systems are developed to relate risk to the Bank’s capital level and methods are in place for monitoring compliance with internal risk management policies and processes. The Committee guides the development of policies, procedures and systems for managing risks. It ensures that these are adequate and appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure and needs of your Bank and its risk appetite. The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence only at the CEO level. The gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are dimensioned and managed include: • Credit Risk including Residual Risks • Market Risk • Operational Risk • • • • • • Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book Liquidity Risk Intraday Liquidity Risk Intraday Credit Risk Credit Concentration Risk Counterparty Credit Risk • Model Risk • • People Risk Business Risk • • • • • Strategic Risk Compliance Risk Reputation Risk Technology Risk Third Party Products Risk • Group Risk • Climate Risk Credit Risk Credit Risk is the possibility of losses"}

Losses stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value. Your Bank has a comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies, procedures, and systems for managing credit risk in its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is managed on an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, given the granularity of individual exposures, retail lending is managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products and customer segments. Robust front-end and back-end systems are in place to ensure credit quality and minimise default losses. The factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit history, loan tenure, and banking behaviour. In addition, multiple credit risk models are developed and used to assess different segments of customers based on portfolio behavior. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping exposures based on borrower group, industry, credit rating grades and country among others. This is backed by portfolio diversification, stringent credit approval processes, periodic post-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures. Your Bank has ensured strong asset quality through volatile times in the lending environment by stringently adhering to prudent norms and institutionalised processes. Your Bank also has a robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, which are reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures are within approved appetite. As on March 31, 2024, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non- Performing Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.24 per cent. Net Non-Performing Assets (Gross Non-Performing Assets Less Specific Loan Loss provisions) was 0.33 per cent of Net Advances. Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than the minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory norms for Standard Assets. 2 3 7 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Digital and Credit Risk Driven by rapid technological advancements, the banking sector is witnessing the increasing importance of digitalisation as a critical differentiator for customer retention"}

Digital lending has emerged as a convenient and quick method for customers to secure loans with just a few clicks often in minutes, if not seconds. However, addressing the risks associated with digital lending is crucial and your Bank has implemented appropriate measures to manage these risks effectively. Digital loans are sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s existing customers. Often, they are customers across multiple products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their credit history and risk profile. This accessibility facilitates the evaluation of their loan eligibility. Moreover, the credit checks and scores used by your Bank in process-based underwriting are replicated for digital loans. This ensures consistency in the evaluation process. Market Risk Market Risk arises primarily from your Bank’s statutory reserve management and trading activity in interest rates, equity, and currency market. These risks are managed through a well- defined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading Policy, and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through trading risk limits / triggers. The risk measures include position limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value-at-Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario-based P&L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL) and are monitored on an end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open positions, currency option delta, and interest rate sensitivity limits are computed and monitored on an intraday basis. This is supplemented by a Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that simulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and initiate remedial measures. Your Bank’s Market Risk capital charge is computed daily using the Standardised Measurement Method applying the regulatory factors. Liquidity Risk the banking book.

Your Bank’s Market Risk capital charge is computed daily using the Standardised Measurement Method applying the regulatory factors. Liquidity Risk the banking book. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. ALCO reviews the policy’s implementation and monitoring of limits. While the maturity gap, Basel III ratios and stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, Net Interest Income impact and market value of equity (MVE) impact help mitigate interest rate risk in the banking book. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board- approved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and interest rate risk. Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded options available to customers, which are used while managing maturity gaps and repricing risk. Further, your Bank has the necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. The LCR, a global standard, is also used to measure your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to ensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day calendar liquidity stress scenario. The LCR helps in improving the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spill over from the financial sector to the real economy. Based on Basel III norms, your Bank’s average LCR stood at 117.35 per cent on a consolidated basis for financial year 2023-24 as against the regulatory threshold at 100 per cent. Average Liquidity Coverage Ratio 117.35 per cent On a Consolidated Basis for the Financial Year 2023-24 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses.

As part of this process, your Bank has established various Board-approved limits for liquidity and interest rate risks in The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a key liquidity risk measure under BCBS liquidity standards, is also used to measure your Bank’s liquidity position. The NSFR seeks to ensure that your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. The NSFR promotes resilience over a longer-term time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with 2 3 8 DIRECTORS’ REPORTHDFC Bank Limited Overview Introduction Our Performance How We Create Value Our Strategy Responsible Business Statutory Reports and Financial Statements more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. The RBI guidelines stipulated a minimum NSFR requirement of 100 per cent at a consolidated level and your Bank has maintained the NSFR well above 100 per cent since its implementation. Based on guidelines issued by RBI, your Bank’s NSFR stood at 120.81 per cent on a consolidated basis March 31, 2024. Operational Risk This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It also includes risk of loss due to legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Given below is a detailed explanation under four different heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information Technology and Information Security Practices and Fraud Monitoring and Control. A. Framework and Process To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, whose implementation is supervised by the Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by the RPMC of the Board. An independent Operational Risk Management Department (ORMD) implements the framework. Under the framework, the Bank has three lines of defence.

In order to achieve the aforesaid objective pertaining to operational risk management framework, the ORMC guides and oversees the functioning, implementation, and maintenance of operational risk management activities of Bank, with special focus on: • Identification and assessment of risks across the Bank through the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) and Scenario analysis • Measurement of Operational Risk based on the actual loss data • Monitoring of risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI) • Management and reporting through KRI, RCSA and operational risk losses of the Bank Internal Audit is the third line of defence. The team reviews the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls within your Bank. B. Internal Control Your Bank has implemented sound internal control practices across all processes, units and functions. It has well laid down policies and processes for the management of its day-to-day activities. Your Bank follows established, well-designed controls, which include traditional four eye principles, effective segregation of business and support functions, segregation of duties, call back processes, reconciliation, exception reporting and periodic MIS.

Fraud Monitoring and Control Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance Policy and a central vigilance team that oversees the implementation of fraud prevention measures. Frauds are investigated to identify the root cause and relevant corrective steps are recommended to prevent recurrence. Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management and Board level also deliberate on high value fraud events and advise preventive actions. Periodic reports are submitted to the Board and senior management committees. Compliance Risk Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of your Bank’s integrity, leading to damage to its reputation, 2 4 0 legal or regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a result of a failure (or perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. Your Bank has a Compliance Policy to ensure the highest standards of compliance. A dedicated team of subject matter experts in the Compliance Department works with business, support and operations teams to ensure active Compliance Risk management and monitoring. The team also provides advisory services on regulatory matters. The focus is on identifying and reducing risk by rigorously testing products and also putting in place robust internal policies. Products that adhere to regulatory norms are tested after rollout and shortcomings, if any, are fully addressed till the product stabilises. Internal policies are reviewed and updated periodically as per agreed frequency or based on market actions or regulatory guidelines/ actions. The compliance team also seeks regular feedback on regulatory compliance from product, business and operation teams through self-certifications and monitoring. ICAAP Your Bank has a structured management framework in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) for the identification and evaluation of the significance of the risks that the Bank faces, which may have a material adverse impact on its business and financial position.

Climate Risk The risks from climate change are divided into (i) Physical risk which captures economic losses from acute impacts on account of extreme weather events or long-term chronic impact on environment; and (ii) Transition risks which captures financial asset level losses due to the possible process of adjustment to a low carbon economy. Your Bank has partnered with an independent reputed global agency for developing a framework to assess climate transition risk at a borrower level for select industries. Additionally, your Bank has taken initiatives to engage in capacity building programs to familiarize the Board and its staff members on the key developments in climate risk assessment, considering this risk is continuously evolving. Stress Testing Framework Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s ICAAP. Stress testing involves the use of various techniques to assess your Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but plausible stressed business conditions. The changes in the levels of Pillar I risks and select Pillar II risks, along with the changes in the on and off-Balance Sheet positions of your Bank are assessed under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity factors. The suite of stress scenarios includes topical themes depending on prevailing geopolitical / macroeconomic / sectoral and other trends. The stress testing outcome may be analysed through capital impact and/or identification of vulnerable borrowers depending on the scenario.

The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors. The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, nature of product, value of security etc., and is also subject to the minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI. Since the identification of Non-performing Advances and provisioning for Non-performing Advances requires considerable level of management estimation, application of various regulatory requirements and in view of its significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key audit matter. How our audit addressed the key audit matter Our audit procedures included the following: Ø Understood the process and controls, and tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information Technology based controls, and focused on the following: • • Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things includes the monitoring of overdue loan accounts and drawing power; Identification and classification of Non-performing IRAC norms, other Advances regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and consideration of qualitative aspects; and in accordance with • Testing of application controls including testing of automated controls and reports. Ø Ø Ø Ø Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that the basis of provisioning is in accordance with the Board of Directors approved policy and IRAC norms. With respect to classification of Non-performing Advances, verified the date of Non-performing Advances and recomputed the Days Past Due on a sample basis. On a test check basis, verified the classification of accounts reported by the Bank as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (‘CRILC’).

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 7. In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 8. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. 9.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date. Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 2. The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility 3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 4.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 6. A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 2 8 8 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTHDFC Bank Limited Overview Introduction Our Performance How We Create Value Our Strategy Responsible Business Statutory Reports and Financial Statements the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion 8. In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

Foreign exchange and derivative contracts Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts. Valuation is considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted to the valuation date using the discounting yields. The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter. Foreign exchange forward contracts and Principal only swaps (POS) not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. The premium or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line basis as expense or income over the life of the contract. The interest income / expense on such POS transaction is accounted on accrual basis.

The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management processes, including providing oversight for managing liquidity risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations is directly managed at the Head Office. The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their liquidity requirements with support from the Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their liquidity requirements under guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews the risk assessment of material risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to monitor liquidity requirements in other currencies as appropriate. In order to determine cash outflows,"}

Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to monitor liquidity requirements in other currencies as appropriate. In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI. The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The present minimum requirement, as on March 31, 2024 is 100%. In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years: Particulars Retail Deposits Small Business Customers Operational deposits Non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks, and PSEs Other legal entities Run-off factors 5% - 10% 5% - 10% 5% - 25% 40% 100% 3 2 3 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Quarter ended March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 LCR Maintained (Average) LCR Required 114.73% 109.54% 120.12% 125.30% 114.85% 112.97% 118.21% 107.43% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% The average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was at 114.73% as against 114.85% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and above the present prescribed minimum requirement of 100%.

The following sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank. 3 4 7 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Interest rate contracts Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve, interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date. The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date discounted for the interest period of the agreement. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal. Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. The writer of the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and floor spreads. Interest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract. Exchange rate contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on a future date.

These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations. Cross currency swaps are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in another specified currency for a specified period. Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before a specified future date. Currency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency on a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one unit of currency with another. The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange risks), within the regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own account (trading activity) principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or implied volatility. The Bank also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. Constituents involved in derivative business The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The Bank has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines.

The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor limits, sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at- risk limits that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for approval. All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified by the market risk and credit risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office. The Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite and the customer’s requirements. Classification of derivatives book The derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on the basis of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within the trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors. Hedging policy For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness.

Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods. The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the Balance Sheet. In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps, the changes in fair value of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS 11.

The interest income / expense on such POS transaction is accounted on accrual basis. • Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial position. The Bank sets up appropriate appetite / limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its 3 4 9 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 obligations in the event of crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events to call for collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. Further, to mitigate the current exposure in non-centrally cleared forex and derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex (‘CSA’) agreements with some of the major international counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions. The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements.

The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2023-24 was the Employee Stock Options. All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC. For Wholetime Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India. The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. In cases where compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable pay will be in cash. (ii) Limits on Variable pay A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period) In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non-cash component in 2023-24 comprised of Employee Stock Options.

A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under deferral arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus is deferred. In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements is not necessary. The deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash components of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules which is approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options. (iv) Vesting of Variable pay The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over the course of the deferral period. The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of the deferral period. The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is more than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. (v) Malus / Clawback Arrangement: The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment. Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.” Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred.

In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.

For Wholetime Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India. Employees other than Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans: (i) Annual Bonus Plan The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the business unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout. Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum and the method of payout across functions. (ii) Performance-linked Plans (PLPs) PLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are exercised independent of these functions. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, and are subject to achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus"}

(iii) Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs) Employees in Job Bands D4 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards and long term sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent. The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC. The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months. In accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay. 3 6 0 SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor the year ended March 31, 2024HDFC Bank Limited Overview Introduction Our Performance How We Create Value Our Strategy Responsible Business Statutory Reports and Financial Statements (iv) Restricted Stock Units (Units) The bank granted units to employees at E3 – D3 bands (upto 10 levels below the MD).

Risk, Control and Compliance Staff The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between revenue generation and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and goals. The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of fixed compensation. Guaranteed Bonus Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance principles of the Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice. For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based on the performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost of attraction into the fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost implication for the Bank. For such hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account appropriate risk factors and market conditions. For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain employees in select strategic roles, a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and would be in the form of Employee Stock Options or Units (All units grants are subject to individual / Business Unit / organizational performance criteria). Severance Pay The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) except in cases where it is mandated by any statute. Hedging The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to insure or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their compensation arrangement. Statutory Bonus Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended from time to"}

Remuneration Processes Fitment at the time of Hire Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials of the incumbent. The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval with appropriate justification. Pay Increment / Pay Revision The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience, job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay. Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year.

The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning for the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, Information Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank. However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis. The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Wholetime Directors), Senior Management, Key Management Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Wholetime Directors is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India. C. Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options). Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay positioning of employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk due to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of misconduct by an employee. Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below: 3 6 2 SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor the year ended March 31, 2024HDFC Bank Limited Overview Introduction Our Performance How We Create Value Our Strategy Responsible Business Statutory Reports and Financial Statements (a) Quarterly / monthly performance-linked"}

PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of non-compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan. (b) Variable Pay: The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk. The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance of the Bank and profitability. The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit and individual performance and job band and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit performance is based on factors such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans and key objectives. Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the employee and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct. The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, Material Risk Takers, Senior Management (i.e. Employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and above). Under the malus clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the claw back clause the"}

Under the malus clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout pertaining to the reference performance year. The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by the NRC and the Board. D. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement period with levels of remuneration The Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors. The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters: 1. Business Performance - This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value. 2. Stakeholder Relationship - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility. 3. Audit and Compliance - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and inspection reports. 4. Digital Transformation - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank. 5. Organizational Excellence - This includes succession planning and employee engagement. While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint: a) Growth in net revenue (%) over previous year; 3 6 3 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 b) Growth in profit before tax (%) over previous year; c) Improvement in cost to income over the previous year; d) Improvement in Gross NPA over the previous year and e) Achievement of key strategic objectives. The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit and individual employees is articulated below: Fixed Pay The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market corrections.

The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit and individual employees is articulated below: Fixed Pay The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market corrections. These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The Bank strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. All other things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual. Variable Pay Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans: • Variable Pay Plans: For Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President I and Above (includes employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Wholetime Directors) the variable pay intends to reward short term as well as long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation. Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. Long term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating and job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of shareholder value. For Employees in job bands Vice President and below: At these levels the variable pay is primarily in the form of cash variable pay and is based on the annual performance. In FY 2023-24, the Bank granted units at E3-D3 bands based on their performance rating, grade and any other such parameter as approved by the NRC. The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band. The bonus multiple is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band and the functional category of"}

A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, could be paid out monthly or quarterly. E. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term performance For employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way. (i) Limits on variable pay A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay. In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the"}

In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non- cash component in 2023-24 comprised of Employee Stock Options. In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay. (ii) Deferral of variable pay For senior management including Wholetime Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements will exist for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred. In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary. The deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash components of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules which will be approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options. (iii) Vesting of Variable Pay The deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the course of the deferral period. The first vesting would not be before one year from the commencement of the deferral period. The vesting would be no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting would be more than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. 3 6 5 Integrated Annual Report"}

The Bank, therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment. Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.” Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances.” The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement: a) Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters b) Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior c) Fraud that requires a financial restatement d) Reputational harm e) Exposing the bank to substantial risk f) Such other conditions or events, of"}

The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors. The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, nature of product, value of security etc., and is also subject to the minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI. Since the identification of Non-performing Advances and provisioning for Non-performing Advances requires considerable level of management estimation, application of various regulatory requirements and in view of its significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key audit matter. How our audit addressed the key audit matter Our audit procedures included the following: Ø Understood the process and controls, and tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information Technology based controls, and focused on the following: • • Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things includes the monitoring of overdue loan accounts and drawing power; Identification and classification of Non-performing IRAC norms, other Advances regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and consideration of qualitative aspects; and in accordance with • Testing of application controls including testing of automated controls and reports.

M. Kapadia & Co., independent firm of Chartered Accountants reproduced by us as under: Key Audit Matter Appropriateness of the Timing of Revenue Recognition in the proper period Refer Schedule 14 of the Special purpose consolidated financial statement and for accounting policy, refer Schedule 17 (8) of the Special purpose consolidated financial Statement. During the period, the Holding Company has recognised premium revenue of R 23,768 crores towards new business (first year premium and single premium). Out of the total revenue recognised, R 9,532 crores were recognised during the last quarter. This area was considered a key audit matter because of the significant concentration of revenue during the last quarter of financial period (including cut-off at the Balance sheet date). Due to the nature of the industry, revenue is skewed towards the balance sheet date. Hence, there is possibility that policy sales of the next financial year are accounted in the current period. How our audit addressed the key audit matter Our procedures included the following: • • • • • • Understood and evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of process and controls relating to recognition of revenue (including testing of key controls for verifying that the revenue has been accrued in the correct accounting period). Tested on a sample basis the policies at the period end to confirm if related procedural compliances with regard to acceptability of the terms of policy were completed before or after the period end"}

The Group followed the intrinsic value method to account for its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation cost was measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined under the option plan. The market price is the closing price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume on the working day immediately preceding the date of grant. In case of unlisted subsidiaries, the fair value is considered in absence of market price. Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted after March 31, 2021, is recognised as an expense in accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of Whole-Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of the stock-based employee compensation is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes model. The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated forfeiture as applicable. Ultimately, the cost for all instruments that vest is recognised. The"}

Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms. As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations. These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills rediscounted by the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; e) Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF); g) Bank guarantees taken. * Also refer Schedule 12 - Contingent liabilities 4 8 3 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 21.

Given the scale of the merger, as with the financials, there is a new starting point for non-financial metrics as well. Thus, the current year’s numbers are not comparable with that of the prior period. Prior to the merger, an Integration Committee was set up to facilitate a seamless and effective integration. Having spearheaded the Integration Committee, suffice to say that ESG was among the core focus areas. Culture, people, processes and systems are the key pillars of building long- term sustainable businesses. The board believes that governance and sustainability are inextricably linked and essential to ensure long-term value creation. Though ESG frameworks are still evolving, the Board is committed to deepening its oversight on ESG and climate- related disclosures. With concerted effort, the Bank has seen a significant improvement in its diversity and retention ratios which augurs well. The Bank is committed to playing a meaningful role in supporting the government’s flagship schemes – be it micro-insurance, pensions, MSME funding and initiatives in digitalisation, agriculture, healthcare, livelihoods, amongst others. The Bank was awarded the ‘Conscious Corporate of the Year’ at the ET Awards, 2023 – an acknowledgement of our efforts on Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG. During the year, the Bank raised its maiden international sustainable bond, which was well received by investors. The Bank has widened its coverage of wholesale loans that undergo Environmental and Social due diligence. Leveraging on the deep corporate relationships, the Bank recognises the importance of being enablers of transition financing to shift to cleaner energy pathways. The Bank is committed to raising the bar on its ESG disclosures. More importantly, the Bank abides by the principles of integrity, transparency and accountability in its ESG reporting.

On a pan- India basis, all the signage convertor vendors were requested to handover the flex to cement factories for co-processing. Accordingly, 6.76 tonnes of flex from 560 locations were collected and handed over to 5 cement companies. Certificates were obtained from the cement companies that the waste would be co-processed and the same was deemed as non- hazardous waste.
